        <p>Of all the pollinator insects, bees are perhaps the most important 
            to crop pollination. According to Michigan State University,
             bees are especially good at pollination because their bodies
              are covered by stiff hairs that attract pollen electrostatically. 
              In addition to feeding on nectar, bees collect pollen from flowers
               to take back to their nests. Bees also tend to focus on one flower
                at a time, thus ensuring flowers of the same species are pollinated.
                 In the United States, European honeybees (a non-native species) are 
                 often used by farmers to pollinate crops. Although honeybee colonies
                  are currently in decline, the Xerces Society reports there are more
                   than 4,000 species of native bees in the United States that are capable
                    of meeting much of the pollination needs of many crops.
