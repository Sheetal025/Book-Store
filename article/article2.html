        <p>Most of the food that humans, insects and animals eat comes from angiosperms,
             or plants that make flowers. Vegetables like peas, tomatoes, peppers, sweet
              corn and broccoli are produced by angiosperms. Grains such as wheat, rice, 
              barley, oats and rye are products of angiosperms, and fruits like apples,
               oranges and bananas all come from flowering plants too. Even plants grown
                to feed livestock often make flowers. Forage crops such as soybeans, clovers, 
                alfalfas and vetches are all flowering plants. Most of the flowering plants 
                that are grown for food, forage and fiber are bought and sold internationally,
                 and our global economic markets are based on the trading of goods that are
                  related directly to the production of flowering plants.The world as we
                   know it depends largely on the success and healthy growth of angiosperms, 
                   or flowering plants. Many of the foods you eat every day rely on help from
                    pollinators like bees to produce abundant crops; in fact, according to some 
                    estimates, one in three bites of food you eat is made possible due to the
                     work of a pollinator. So, next time you enjoy a crunchy bite of an apple
                      or a juicy tomato, take time to thank both the flower and the pollinator
                       that made that food possible!</p>
