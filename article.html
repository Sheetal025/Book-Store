                    RELATED How Do Insects Pollinate Flowers? Updated December 02, 2021 By Meg Schader
                    Reviewed by: Sylvie Tremblay, M.Sc. Molecular Biology and Genetics
                    What is the importance of flowers in nature? Besides adding color, 
                    texture and biodiversity to gardens and ecosystems, flowers are botanically 
                    important structures and essential sources of food for many organisms. 
                    The flower is an important means of attracting pollinators to a plant,
                     which is necessary in order for the plant to produce seeds, 
                     reproductive structures that allow a species to exist generation after generation.
                      Flowers also protect seeds as they develop, ensuring the successful transfer 
                      of genetic material to the next generation. Plants that make flowers are called
                       angiosperms, and they are a group that has evolved to encompass a wide
                        range of diversity in size, form and color.Value of Flowers</p>

                <p>The main function of flowers is to attract pollinators to plants to ensure
                     the reproduction and survival of the plant species. Many plants and pollinators
                      have adapted characteristics to ensure a mutually beneficial relationship for each organism. 
                      Just as plants rely on bees, bats, moths and hummingbirds for help pollinating their flowers,
                       these species depend on nectar and pollen from flowers for nutrition.
                       For instance, some flowers produce two types of pollen: one for pollination, 
                       and one to feed pollinators. Other flowers have intricate designs on their petals
                        called nectar guides to help pollinators find the pollen within their flowers. 
                        The color, shape and fragrance of most flowers has evolved over thousands of
                         years to benefit both the plant species and the pollinators that visit that flower.</p>
